		<h2>Cease and desist letter generator</h2>
		
		If someone is using your design without your permission, use a cease and desist letter to make a formal request for them to stop ("cease") and not continue ("desist") 
		this behavior. Generate a cease and desist letter and send it to the person or company infringing your intellectual property rights. Attach your original design 
		and screenshots showing where/how the infringer is using it without your permission.
		<br><br>
		After receiving this letter, if the infringing person or company does not cease and desist, then you should contact the authorities who can take action  
		against the infringer. For example, if your design is being used on a website, then send the letter to the hosting provider of that website. If your design is being 
		used on YouTube, Facebook or any other social media site, then contact the support for that site, or fill out the copyright infringement form.
		<br><br>
		The same cease and desist letter can be printed and sent to a physical address, preferably as a certified letter.

				If you do not comply with this cease and desist demand within this time period, I am entitled to use your failure to comply as evidence of "willful infringement" 
				and seek monetary damages and equitable relief for your copyright infringement. In the event you fail to meet this demand, please be advised that I will contemplate 
				pursuing all available legal remedies, including seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, and an order that you pay court costs and attorney's fees. Your 
				liability and exposure under such legal action could be considerable.
				<br><br>
				Before taking these steps, however, I wish to give you one opportunity to discontinue your illegal conduct by complying with this demand within ten (10) days. 
				Accordingly, please reply to this email within ten (10) days with your acceptance of the attached Agreement.
				<br><br>
				The foregoing is without waiver of any and all rights of myself, all of which are expressly reserved herein. If you or your attorney have any questions, please 
				contact me directly.
				<br><br>
				Sincerely,
				<br><br>
				{{letterYourName}}
