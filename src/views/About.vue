    Set in Block is an <a href="https://github.com/giekaton/set-in-block" target="_blank">open-source</a> project with the mission to promote long-term thinking by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, through decentralized publishing and content protection tools, available at Set in Block.
    <br><br>
    Functionally, the Set in Block dApp allows users to read and write data to the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br><br>
    The data stored in the blockchain is immutable and permanent, simlar to the idiom <i>set in stone</i>, which is used to describe something that cannot be changed.
    <br><br>
    Use the Set in Block Reader to read messages and NFTs permanently stored in the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br><br>
    Use the Set in Block Writer to create blockchain-based permanent messages, protect copyrights, license authentic work, mint NFTs.

    <h2 style="text-align:left;margin-bottom:30px;">How it works</h2>

    You can use Set in Block visual interfaces to create Ethereum blockchain messages, protect copyrights, mint NFTs. The submission is done on the client-side, using your MetaMask wallet. For privacy reasons, every new Set in Block message is sent to a randomly generated Ethereum address.
    <br><br>
    Your message, recorded in the blockchain, is immutable and incorruptible - no one can delete or modify it. It also never expires - it's a permanent record. 
    <br><br>
    By having a message archived on the blockchain, you have a mathematically-based proof of existence that your message is authentic, and that it existed prior to a 
    specific date.
    <br><br>
    The message you enter in the Set in Block new message interface is encoded into a hexadecimal format and then included in the data field of the Ethereum blockchain transaction.
    <br><br>
    Set in Block message submission interface only encodes and prepares the message. After the submit button is pressed, you will be asked to confirm the transaction with your <a href="https://medium.com/publicaio/a-complete-guide-to-using-metamask-updated-version-cd0d6f8c338f" target="_blank">MetaMask</a> wallet and by doing this, to create a permanent record - a true proof of existence.
    <br><br>
    The value of your prepared transaction is 0. The longer is your message, the bigger is the transaction fee. Gas Limit is calculated automatically, according to the size of your message. Gas Price is set to 3 Gwei, but can be changed, depending on the network conditions.
    <br><br>
    We never see your private key or any other personal data, as the transaction is broadcast on the client-side, through the MetaMask extension. You can inspect 
    the code of our website by looking into its source and visiting its <a href="https://github.com/giekaton/set-in-block" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository.
    <br><br>
    After the message is added to the blockchain, it is no longer possible to change or delete it. Also, the time and the date of the message creation 
    is impossible to change - that's the proof of existence. The unique quality of the blockchain is that it is immutable and incorruptible, and because of its decentralized nature, 
    the data you add to the blockchain stays there forever.
    <br><br>
    The message submission is anonymous and for every message, a new random receiving Ethereum address is generated. Besides Google Analytics with IP anonymization, we do not use any trackers or cookies. We do not use a database and do not 
    collect any information about the website users.
    <br><br>
    The options for setting things in block are endless. By recording a file's hash in the blockchain, you can <i>set in block</i> virtually anything. The thing represented in the file, no matter the format, receives an immutable and incorruptible timestamp, which works as a proof-of-existence. Such proof never expires, it cannot be edited or deleted, and it can always be independently verified.
