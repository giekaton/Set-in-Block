    Set in Block is an <a href="https://github.com/giekaton/set-in-block" target="_blank">open-source</a> Web3 project with the mission to promote long-term thinking by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain through decentralized publishing and content protection tools, available at Set in Block.
    <br><br>
    Functionally, Set in Block dApp allows users to read and write data to the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br><br>
    The data stored in the blockchain is immutable and permanent, simlar to the idiom <i>set in stone</i>, which is used to describe something that cannot be changed.
    <br><br>
    Use the Set in Block Reader to read messages and NFTs permanently stored in the Ethereum blockchain.
    <br><br>
    Use the Set in Block Writer to create blockchain-based permanent messages, protect copyrights, license authentic work, mint NFTs.

    <h2 style="text-align:left;margin-bottom:30px;">How it works</h2>

    You can use the Set in Block Writer visual interfaces to create Ethereum blockchain messages, protect copyrights, mint NFTs. The submission is done on the client-side, using your MetaMask wallet.
    <br><br>
    By having a message recorded on the blockchain, you have a mathematically-based proof of existence that your message is authentic, and that it existed prior to a specific date.
    <br><br>
    The message submission is anonymous and for every message, a new random receiving Ethereum address is generated. Besides Google Analytics with IP anonymization, we do not use any trackers or cookies. We do not use a database and do not collect any information about the website users.
    <br><br>
    The options for setting things in block are endless. By recording a file's hash in the blockchain, you can <i>set in block</i> virtually anything. The thing represented in the file, no matter the format, receives an immutable and incorruptible timestamp, which works as a proof-of-existence. Such proof never expires, it cannot be edited or deleted, and it can always be independently verified.
