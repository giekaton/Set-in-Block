# Set in Block

[Set in Block](https://setinblock.com) is a decentralized app (dApp) that allows users to read and write data to the Ethereum blockchain.

The dApp uses [web3](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js), [web3Modal](https://github.com/Web3Modal/web3modal), and [WalletConnect](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo) JavaScript libraries to establish connection with the Ethereum blockchain, prepare and sign transactions client-side, and allow users to broadcast them with their Ethereum wallets.

Set in Block is a free and open-source digital service based on the Ethereum blockchain, powered by [Infura](https://infura.io/), [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) APIs.

The Set in Block dApp is written in Vue.js, with a minimal PHP backend. It doesn't use a server-side database.
